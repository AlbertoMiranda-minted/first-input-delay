First Input Delay is a proposed metric for measuring page interactivity during page load.
Details on the metric can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tnobrn4I8ObzreIztfah_BYnDkbx3_ZfJV5gj2nrYnY/edit#heading=h.o1ndiexuafyv).

The demo [here](https://tdresser.github.io/first-input-delay/) logs the First Input Delay to the console.
